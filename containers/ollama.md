CT102, hostname `ollama`, **192.168.0.13**. Runs Ollama for LLM inference against the
Radeon 890M iGPU via the Vulkan backend (not ROCm — gfx1150 support under ROCm is flaky).

# Privilege mode — confirm before assuming

As of the GPU-passthrough work this container remains **unprivileged**, with an idmap
carve-out mapping the host's render group through (Dave weighed converting to privileged
but took the idmap path instead). Confirm before assuming:

```bash
grep unprivileged /etc/pve/lxc/102.conf
```

# GPU passthrough & inference

Full device passthrough, idmap, Mesa backports, and the `OLLAMA_IGPU_ENABLE=1` chain are
documented in [GPU passthrough & Ollama on Vulkan](/playbooks/gpu-passthrough-ollama-vulkan.md).
Symptoms that send you to that playbook: `library=cpu`, `total_vram="0 B"`, `dropping
integrated GPU`, or slow inference.

# Storage

Model store is `AIVault/ollama-models` on the [AIVault](/storage/aivault.md) pool,
bind-mounted into this container at `/mnt/models` (`OLLAMA_MODELS=/mnt/models`).

# Frontend

[openwebui (CT106)](openwebui.md) is the chat frontend for this container.
